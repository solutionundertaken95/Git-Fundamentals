🚀 Git Basics Cheat Sheet

A simple and clean reference for commonly used Git commands.

🏁 1. Initialize & Setup
📦 git init

Initializes the current folder as a Git repository.
Creates a hidden .git folder which means Git has started tracking the project.

👤 git config --global user.name "Your Name"
📧 git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

Sets your name and email for commits.
✔️ One-time setup (global configuration).

To verify:

git config --list

📥 git clone -b develop <repository-url>

Clones a specific branch (develop) from a remote repository.

Example:

git clone -b develop https://github.com/user/repo.git

🔍 2. Checking Changes
📄 git status

Shows:

Modified files

Staged files

Untracked files

🔎 git diff

Shows changes made but NOT added to staging area.

📊 git diff --stat

Shows summary of changes:

1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)

📌 git diff --staged

Shows changes that are staged and ready to commit.

➕ 3. Staging Files
📂 git add .

Adds ALL modified files to staging.

📄 git add <file-name>

Adds a specific file to staging.

💾 4. Committing Changes
📝 git commit -m "Your message"

Creates a commit (snapshot of your staged changes).

✏️ git commit --amend

Modifies the last commit:

Add missed files

Edit commit message

⚠️ Only safe before pushing.

Verify using:

git log

📜 5. Viewing History
🕒 git log

Shows full commit history.

🧾 git log --oneline

Compact version of commit history.

🌳 git log --graph

Shows commits in a visual tree format.

🌿 6. Branching
🌱 git branch <branch-name>

Creates a new branch.

📋 git branch

Lists all branches and highlights the current one.

🔄 git checkout <branch-name>

Switches to another branch.

✨ (New & Recommended) git switch <branch-name>

Modern alternative to git checkout for switching branches.

🌿➡️🌿 git merge <branch-name>

Merges another branch into the current branch.

✔️ Always switch to the branch where you want the code merged before running this.

🌍 7. Working with Remote Repositories
🔗 git remote add origin <repository-url>

Links your local repository to a remote GitHub repository.

📤 git push -u origin <branch-name>

Pushes your branch to GitHub.

-u sets upstream (so future pushes can use just git push)

📥 git pull

Fetches and merges changes from remote repository.

📡 git fetch

Fetches changes from remote WITHOUT merging.

🚫 8. Ignoring Files
📄 .gitignore

Contains list of files/folders Git should NOT track.

Example:

node_modules/
*.log
.env

🔁 9. Undoing Changes
❌ Unstage a file
git restore --staged <file-name>

🔙 Discard local changes
git restore <file-name>

⏮️ Reset to previous commit (soft)
git reset --soft HEAD~1


Keeps changes staged.

⏮️ Reset to previous commit (hard)
git reset --hard HEAD~1


⚠️ Deletes changes permanently.

🧹 10. Deleting Branches
🗑️ Delete local branch
git branch -d <branch-name>

🗑️ Delete remote branch
git push origin --delete <branch-name>

💡 Pro Tips

Always git pull before starting work.

Commit small logical changes.

Write meaningful commit messages.

Use feature branches for development.
